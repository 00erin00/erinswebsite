            here is a gellery of a few pictures in the game. Steep is a sports video game developed by Ubisoft Annecy and published by Ubisoft. It was released worldwide on 2 December 2016 for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One.
            Developed by Ubisoft Annecy beginning in 2013, it was their first original game.

            It is set in the Alps, where players can participate in several winter and action sports disciplines, skiing, snowboarding, paragliding and wingsuit flying. 
            With later downloadable content, mountains in Alaska, Japan and Korea were also included in the game and rocket-powered wingsuit flying, sledding, BASE jumping, and speed riding were incorporated as additional sports.
            Furthermore, two of the game's expansions allowed the player to take part in the Winter X Games and the 2018 Winter Olympics. 
            The game places a great emphasis on online multiplayer, focusing on competing in various winter sporting challenges with other players online.
